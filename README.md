# 🌍 Access to Drinking Water (2000–2020) 


### Data Transformation & Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes global access to basic drinking water services between *2000 and 2020*.  
Using spreadsheet-based data analysis techniques, the project transforms raw data into meaningful insights about trends, inequalities, and progress across *national, rural, and urban populations*.

The analysis aligns with *United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): Clean Water and Sanitation*.

---

## Objectives
The main goals of this project were to:

- Understand the structure of a real-world global dataset  
- Investigate how water access data is distributed across years  
- Calculate *Annual Rates of Change (ARC)* for water access  
- Compare access across national, rural, and urban populations  
- Identify countries with *full access* to basic water services  
- Analyze differences in progress between rural and urban areas  
- Compare water access improvements across global regions  
- Present findings using charts, histograms, and pivot tables

## Skills Demonstrated

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Sorting data by multiple fields  
- Creating calculated columns  
- Handling missing values using error-safe formulas  
- Rounding values for logical classification  

### Data Analysis
- Minimum, maximum, and average calculations  
- Year difference analysis (y_diff)  
- Annual Rates of Change (ARC) calculations  
- Conditional logic using IF, AND, and IFERROR  
- Regional aggregation using pivot tables  

### Data Visualization
- Histograms (distribution analysis)  
- Scatter plots (relationship analysis)  
- Summary tables and charts  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- *Google Sheets / Excel*  
- Spreadsheet formulas (IF, IFERROR, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, ROUND, VLOOKUP)  
- Pivot Tables  
- Charts & Visualizations  

---

## Engineered Features
The original dataset was expanded with the following features:

- y_diff — Difference between recorded years per country  
- ARC_n — Annual Rate of Change (National)  
- ARC_r — Annual Rate of Change (Rural)  
- ARC_u — Annual Rate of Change (Urban)  
- Rounded water access columns for accurate classification  
- Full-access indicators (full access)  
- ARC_diff — Difference between rural and urban ARC values  
- region — Added using lookup for geographic comparison  

A dedicated *Global 2000–2020 Report* summary sheet consolidates statistics and visualizations.

---

## Key Insights
- Water access data was not collected annually for all countries, requiring careful year-difference calculations.  
- Rural areas often showed higher rates of improvement, suggesting targeted development efforts.  
- Countries with 100% access impact average ARC values and must be treated separately.  
- Regional analysis reveals uneven global progress and highlights areas needing intervention.
